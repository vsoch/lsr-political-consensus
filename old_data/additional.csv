I felt like we agreed on most issues but it was interesting to see some other conservatives opinions on issues.   ,I thought that the study was well made and had an interesting layout.  I hope that I provided some interesting data to the research.,I didn't notice anything strange.

I thought we were all capable and mostly united in our decisions. It was great to see common ground on most issues.,I really liked the issues that were chosen for participants. When I answered the issues| I took what others chose in consideration. This study seemed like a great forum to decide on issues.,I thought the researchers were trying to determine how similar views on issues are among people with similar political ideals.

It really didn't feel like interaction between humans but it was.,I was thinking about being on top of the situation| answering promptly and not making my fellow turkers wait for my reply (like Player B did).,I thought the study was to engage and measure conservatives. Observing everyone's collection opinions on various current topics?,Obviously Obama care is not very popular! Thanks for letting me participate.

As the questions went along I felt like I got another piece of the puzzle to get a more clear picture of who that person is.,I was thinking about my own beliefs and answering honestly.  I was thinking about the other participants answers and trying to get an idea of what that person is like. ,I think the study was not only trying to see how each individual felt about political issues| but also trying to see if people would answer the questions about issues similar to the other participants.  For example if three people said strongly oppose an issue you might expect there to be a high correlation with the 4th person answering strongly oppose or somewhat near that.,Thank you for offering this study.

I found in a few cases they were and in a few they weren't predictable. for most anything| the correct answer is probably somewhere in the middle| it's a case by case basis. maybe the true believer never changes their position and only wants what they want| for everyone else we have to take the good with the bad in the interest of progress,a little bit on the process| was a little hard to get any sense of who each other person was when the order of the answers keep changing. the numbers and the checkboxes didn't line up even zoomed out which made it difficult for no reason except poor testing and bad formatting. on average we all know how most people who identify with each group is going to answer so what are we going to learn?,could you predict on average how people would choose when confronted with others who are likely to choose in somewhat predictable ways or would they moderate their choices?,you mention maximizing the browser if the questions don't appear| actually| zooming is also important if maximizing the browser doesn't solve the problem. tiny text is the result of zooming out and it didn't really solve the format problem of too much space between elements I guess a larger screen would hide the problem for most people.||,since it was a week ago| i can't say absolutely which questions were or weren't included.  the questions were about the same things asked about in the interactive portion: gun control restrictions| immigration policy and citizenship| legalizing marijuana| extreme debriefing measures and others related to how I view the world and my attitudes on life,30,TRUEA9GNNAGBWOFAM,6,4,4,5,5,5,4,4,5,4,4,5,5,5,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,Beside seeing there answer| the interaction was limited.

I am relatively confident in most of my opinions that were asked about so I would often choose my responses straight off so that I wouldn't be tempted to change them based on other participant's responses. I wondered if others were approaching it similarly. ,I thought about how there are a lot of different forms of liberalism in this country and numerous levels within them all. I thought about the differences in political candidate supporters| for example those who support Hilary Clinton versus those who support Bernie Sanders.,"I thought it was strange that when I opened the study at 1:59| all of the \""participants\"" were already there.
