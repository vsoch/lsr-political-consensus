			<p>Thank you for completing the study! In this study we were interested in the political attitudes that liberals and conservatives would report after seeing the attitudes of like-minded others. You were paired with three other people who reported the same political ideology (liberal or conservative) as you did in a survey that you completed several weeks ago. We were interested in whether people might differ in their tendency to conform to their fellow group membersâ€™ attitudes. For example, liberals might do this more than conservatives, or conservatives might do this more than liberals.</p>
